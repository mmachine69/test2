Let’s do some math then!

He wants to exchange 30K CHF.  
At the moment of writing this post, the rates are  
IB bid/ask  
3.84550 3.84591  
Walutomat bid/ask  
3,8478 3,8410

So that’s 115377.3 PLN at IB or 115230 PLN, minus 230 PLN fee, so a grand total of 115000 at Walutomat.

Add 20-30 CHF of GIRO fees from PF and it adds up to ~120 CHF, so it’s exactly the same cost all in, but a full year of free trading at IB is not something to walk past by.
