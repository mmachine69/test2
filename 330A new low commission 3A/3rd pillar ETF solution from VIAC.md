Only CSIF funds holding US stocks are not tax efficient.  
It can be calculated.

Letâ€™s take, a Swissfund tracking the S&P500 and and IE fund tracking the S&P500.  
If the dividend yield is 2%, the IE fund will be taxed at 15% on dividends (15%\*2%=0.3 %) and the Swissdfund taxed at 30% on dividends (15%\*2%=0.6 %). The difference is 0.3% (30 bps).

WIthout taking any other cost, the swiss fund will have 0.3% lower performances.

Luxemburg funs like SRI from UBS have the same tax rate as swiss funds.  
You would need to select this fund: S&P500 (IE00B5BMR087)
