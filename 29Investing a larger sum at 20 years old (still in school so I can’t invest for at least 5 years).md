> So you want to invest all of of your 3a money in a (USD-denominated) broadly diversified Global/World fund? Well… you can’t!

Strawman argument: 3A shouldn’t be your sole investment, it’s just a component. You can build a diversified global portfolio even with your 3A entirely invested in Swiss stocks, even easier if your 3A is part-Swiss.

The cat is out of the bag. Now that VIAC have shown what’s possible, competition is only likely to increase.

> You’re almost inevitably going to be overexposed to Swiss investments and the Swiss Franc. What if the Swiss economy goes down the drain or crashes? For whatever reason. A local black swan event, maybe: Say…Zurich receives 8m flash floods by a dam breaking at Sihlsee? Or higher, due to mudslide, glacial retreat in the alps? Basel gets all but destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake in the Rhine plain. A nuclear plant blows up? How long will it take you to get your funds out? Out of 3a only a few days, if I you can trade somewhere, and the databases have been backed up somewhere. With 3a? Weeks, months, if not longer. But will they or emergency legislation even let you?

What if the nuclear station next to Valley Forge PA explodes? What if the US introduce laws confiscating the property of all non-US citizens? What if IB go rogue? What if New York (stock exchanges) get destroyed by nuclear attack?

Again straw-man argument since no one was arguing to have your entire portfolio consist of only the 3A.

Even then: Swiss returns over more than a century are strong, more so when taking into account currency efffects. That’s not guaranteed to continue, but institutuons and laws are necessarily a large influence on that and aren’t going to change anytime soon. You aren’t likely to shoot yourself in the foot with a Swiss bias (it’s a stupid idea diversification-wise, but not that terrible).
