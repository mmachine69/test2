Hi,

Where are you located?

You can get the stamp later on if you bring the receipt and the marchandise. Iâ€™ve done that conveniently at Geneva Cornavin train station.

Also, more and more tax-free forms are electronic (PABLO system in France for example) and you can just validate your claim through a kiosk. Most of the time no human intervention is needed.
