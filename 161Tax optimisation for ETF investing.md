Hello there,

I have a question, probably a silly one, regarding tax optimization for ETF. I do understand that for ETFs that hold a significant percentage of US securities, it is beneficial to hold the US based one instead of the UCIT version e.g. Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) instead of Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF Distributing (VWRD). This is due to the US/Switzerland tax treaty allowing us the reclaim the amount withhold by the US only for the US domiciled ETF. I am not even talking about the lower TER.

Now, for ETF that does not hold US securities such as emerging market ones of developed world ex-US. Besides a usually lower TER for the US domiciled ETF, is there a reason to hold the US domiciled one instead of an UCIT one? For example, a good US domiciled emerging market ETF would be Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO), TER=0.12%. An UCIT one would be the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets IMI UCITS ETF, TER=0.18%. For sure, they do not track the same index and the UCIT one has a slightly higher TER. But beside that, is there a strong reason to hold the US domiciled one instead of the UCIT one?
