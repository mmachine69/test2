i havnt spent time thinking on this topic so far. my current bet is that i like the zurich theatre so much that i wont move away. maybe out of city zurich, but definately not far away.

taxes are not smallest, but all the infrastructure, the cultural offerings and the central position of zurich main station to reach out to anywhere in switzerland are a good deal for me. on top of that, i am fond of my social network here.

But, all this might be subject to change, so i will probably at a later point make up my mind. with my net worth approaching 9% FIRE, i still have some time^^
