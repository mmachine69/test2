> When I crunch the numbers with a ROI of 6% and a SWR of 4%, this gives me that I could FIRE in 16 years.

You almost said it: The “catch” that seems to good to be true might be the assumption of 6% yearly ROI going forward.

The latest boom in world indices can largely be attributed to the performance of U.S. equity - which constitutes the biggest portion (roughly half) of world market capitalization. Whereas with other big indices (for example Japanese Nikkei), you could have gone for 20+ years with negative annualized returns.

> There are so many promises/scams on internet on how you be rich staying at home doing nothing

I am somewhat new to this “scene”, so don’t know much about other’s opinions. For me at least, financial independence is not necessarily about “staying at home and doing nothing”. It doesn’t even mean one should or must quit his job, etc.

> But that 6% is without taxes, if you consider taxes, the 6% are eroding, isn’t it?

The bigger share of that is not dividends but capital appreciation - which (luckily) Switzerland, unlike some other countries, usually does _not_ consider as taxable _income_, for _non-professional_ investors.
