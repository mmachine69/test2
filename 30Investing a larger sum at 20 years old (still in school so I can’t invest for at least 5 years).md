> Strawman argument: 3A shouldn’t be your sole investment, it’s just a component

Me: “_\[Can’t\] invest all of your 3a money in…_”  
You: “_3A shouldn’t be your sole investment \[anyway\]_”  
Whose argument is the strawman’s argument here?

Notwithstanding that the question wasn’t really an argument in itself but a mere example for my argument: 3a will confine your investment opportunities, limit possible allocation and restrict your withdrawal options.

An argument that still stands.

Especially in light of you having claimed…

> Even if you had 0 income tax rate today (i.e. no tax saving by paying into the 3A), the 3A will come out ahead in the long run

…3A would “come out ahead in the long run” (**come out ahead against what, I ask?!**), even going so far as to equate other (inferior) choices to “throwing away 60k”:

> You’re limited to about 7k per year that you have taxable income, which reduces the amount you can use. That 7k can turn into 380k minus 3A withdrawal tax in a 3A with average historical returns versus only 290k if you have to pay tax on dividends (and that’s not even taking into account the tax deduction initially).

> If you want to throw away about 60k then go ahead, but don’t say you weren’t warned.

And this was the **center of my argument: The comparison between 3a and non-3a (implicitly) assuming _same_ average returns is unwarranted**.

You’re not going to have the same average returns. Not even pre-tax, as you just can’t duplicate many asset allocations in 3a that you could otherwise pursue out of it.

I don’t think there will ever be a consensus that everyone will agree on, regarding what would constitute a best-diversified global equity portfolio (component). However, MSCI is certainly one of the most popular approaches or “approximations” to that. Which you won’t be able to have in 3a. Countering that with you shouldn’t have all of your funds in 3a and a Swiss home bias would be good anyway sounds like… well, it was you who came up with the allegations of straw-man arguments.

> Swiss returns over more than a century are strong, more so when taking into account currency efffects. That’s not guaranteed to continue, but institutuons and laws are necessarily a large influence on that and aren’t going to change anytime soon. You aren’t likely to shoot yourself in the foot with a Swiss bias (it’s a stupid idea diversification-wise, but not that terrible).

I would agree with you on that, that a Swiss home bias is sound and might turn out well. However, the assertion “laws aren’t going to change anytime soon” pales against a 45-year time horizon here. 45 years ago, the Soviet Union was still going strong (though not really economically). For Switzerland, all it might take is a more serious dispute with the European Union over corporate taxation or trade. Everyone is free to painting out possible scenarios for themselves.
