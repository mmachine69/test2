Hi all,

I have a question as well on purchasing USD for CHF.  
First time I did it I followed Bojack’s approach, with using FXCONV instead of IDEALPRO, through TWS interface.  
Once performed, I had no visible entries for USD.CHF pair in my portfolio.

However when I went to convert to USD through my phone for the second time, I believe only IDEALPRO was available.  
After I used that method, USD.CHF pair showed up under my positions.

Now my questions are:

1.  Any disadvantages when using IDEALPRO vs FXCONV? (e.g. if I want to trade while on the move, away from my laptop)  
    –> Self-answered (as I see now that it has been addressed earlier in this thread; and further explained [here 4](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/tws/usersguidebook/realtimeactivitymonitoring/fx_portfolio_-_virtual_fx_position.htm)): No, it just seems to create a virtual FX position. Useful if you want to track evolution of your CHF-USD pair.
2.  Is it actually beneficial, if it’s necessary for future tax reports to have that USD.CHF pair reported, for profits/losses?

Thanks and happy new stashing year everyone!
